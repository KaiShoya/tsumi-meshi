# v0.1.2 Tasks — Polish & Improvements

## Goal
Ship a small, focused release that polishes the v0.1.1 features (folders, tags, checks, search) and improves stability, accessibility, and CI/release workflow.

## Tasks

- **Tests & Quality**
  - [x] Add additional integration tests for `GET /recipes` covering edge cases (no tags, large tag list, SQL injection sanity checks)
  - [x] Add e2e smoke test for core flows (create recipe, add tag, check recipe)

- **UI / UX**
  - [x] Accessibility audit for folder/tag UI and fix issues (keyboard nav, ARIA)
  - [x] Add axe-core dev dependency and FolderSelector a11y test
  - [x] Fix `FolderSelector` label/select association (ARIA)
  - [x] Improve responsiveness for mobile views
  - [x] Minor design polish for `FolderSelector` and tag list

- **CI / Release**
  - [x] Add release workflow to create GitHub release and tag (in `release/v0.1.2` branch)
  - [x] Ensure `Specs Check` workflow includes a step to validate `CHANGELOG.md` update on release
  - [x] Expand CI matrix (node versions / pnpm)

- **Docs / Specs**
  - [ ] Update `.agent/specs/*` if any API/behavioral changes are introduced
  - [x] Add draft `v0.1.2` entry to `CHANGELOG.md`

## Acceptance criteria
- New tests added and green in CI
- UI accessibility issues resolved
- Release workflow creates a GitHub release and tag

## Timeline
- Target: v0.1.2 in next sprint
