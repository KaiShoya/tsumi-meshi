# v0.1.3 Tasks — Technical Debt & Follow-ups

## Goal
Address technical debt and finish incomplete implementation TODOs discovered during v0.1.2 work.

## Tasks

- **Repository / API TODOs**
  - [ ] Implement Cloudflare Workers API calls in `app/composables/useAuth.ts` (owner: @kai, estimate: 2d)
  - [ ] Implement missing repository/store API calls for tags and recipes (`app/stores/data/*`) (owner: TBD, estimate: 3d)

- **UI / UX**
  - [ ] Implement global loading states in `app/stores/pages/recipes.ts` (owner: TBD, estimate: 1d)
  - [ ] Integrate NuxtUI toasts in `app/composables/useAppToast.ts` (owner: @kai, estimate: 1d)
  - [ ] Add confirmation dialog where TODO present in `app/pages/index.vue` (owner: TBD, estimate: 1d)

- **Maintenance**
  - [ ] Triage and convert remaining `TODO` comments into Issues with owners and estimates (owner: @kai, estimate: 1d)
  - [ ] Schedule follow-up sprint for v0.1.3 and set target dates (owner: @kai, estimate: 0.5d)

## Acceptance criteria
- Each code change has unit and/or integration tests where applicable
- Accessibility (axe) tests added/updated for UI changes
- `.agent/specs/*` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated with summary of v0.1.3 changes
- All PRs pass CI (lint/typecheck/tests)

## Next steps
1. Triage in-code TODOs and open Issues (start here)
2. Pick the highest-impact Issue (auth integration suggested) and implement with tests
3. Update specs/docs and open PRs per change


## Timeline
- Target: v0.1.3 (next sprint)
