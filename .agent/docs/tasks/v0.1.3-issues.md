# v0.1.3 — TODO triage (issues/tasks)

This file converts in-code TODO comments into tracked tasks for v0.1.3.

## Tasks

1. app/pages/index.vue — Confirmation dialog
   - File: `app/pages/index.vue`
   - TODO: `// TODO: Show confirmation dialog`
   - Description: When user triggers the action (delete/clear/check?), show a confirmation modal before proceeding.
   - Owner: `@kai` (or `frontend`)
   - Estimate: 1d
   - Acceptance: Modal matches design, keyboard accessible, unit test for invocation, integration test verifies flow.
   - Status: Completed (implemented and tested)

2. app/composables/useAuth.ts — Cloudflare Workers API calls (login/register)
   - File: `app/composables/useAuth.ts`
   - TODOs: "Implement API call to Cloudflare Workers" (multiple locations)
   - Description: Implement actual HTTP calls to Cloudflare Workers endpoints for `login`, `register`, `me` and token refresh as per `.agent/specs/auth.md`.
   - Owner: `@kai` (backend/client integration)
   - Estimate: 1.5d
   - Acceptance: Unit tests for happy/failure paths, type-safe responses, update `.agent/specs/auth.md` if behavior changes.
   - Status: Completed (API integration + tests present)

3. Repositories / Stores — tags/recipes API TODOs
   - Files: `app/repositories/*`, `app/stores/data/*`
   - TODO: missing behaviors for create/update/delete/pagination
   - Description: Audit repository and store implementations for `tags` and `recipes` and implement missing API calls or behaviors.
   - Owner: `@kai` (repositories) and `TBD` (stores)
   - Estimate: 2d
   - Acceptance: Unit tests for repositories and stores, integration tests for API flows.
   - Status: Completed (repositories implemented; stores updated)

4. Misc TODOs — tech debt sweep
   - Files: various (use `grep "TODO"` to find exact lines)
   - Description: Create issues for remaining TODOs with owner and estimate; prioritize into backlog.
   - Owner: `@kai`
   - Estimate: 0.5d

5. app/composables/useLogger.ts — Logging integration
   - File: `app/composables/useLogger.ts`
   - TODO: `// TODO: Implement proper logging (NewRelic integration)`
   - Description: Provide a pluggable logging adapter (console in dev, NewRelic/other in prod) and ensure structured logs are emitted for errors and key flows.
   - Owner: `@kai`
   - Estimate: 0.5d
   - Status: Completed (pluggable adapter implemented)

6. Full TODO scan summary
   - Found TODOs in: `app/composables/useAuth.ts` (multiple), `app/pages/index.vue`, `app/repositories/*`, `app/stores/data/*`, `app/composables/useLogger.ts`, plus various doc TODOs in `.agent/docs`.
   - Next action: Create GitHub Issues only for remaining misc TODOs (see section 4) and link back to this file and to `.agent/docs/tasks/v0.1.3-tasks.md`.

---

## Next steps
- Confirm owners/estimates or adjust to team assignments.
- Create GH issues from above tasks (or track in project board).
- Implement in order: (1) confirmation dialog, (2) auth API integration, (3) repository/store work, (4) tech debt triage.

## Misc TODOs (scan results & suggested actions)

The codebase contains scattered TODOs and doc TODO notes; these are lower-risk tech-debt items to sweep.

A. `app/stores/data/*` — Audit stores for TODOs and missing behaviors
   - Files: `app/stores/data/checks.ts`, `app/stores/data/folders.ts`, `app/stores/data/recipes.ts`, `app/stores/data/tags.ts`
   - Action: Inspect each store for TODOs or missing error handling; add unit tests where needed.
   - Priority: P2
   - Estimate: 1d

B. Documentation TODOs — `.agent/docs/*` and in-repo docs
   - Files: `.agent/docs/*` (QA entries, tasks, specs)
   - Action: Consolidate doc TODOs into `.agent/docs/tasks/v0.1.3-issues.md` (this file) and mark actionable items as Issues or backlog tasks.
   - Priority: P3
   - Estimate: 0.5d

C. Tests TODOs — small test cleanups
   - Files: `tests/*` (see `grep "TODO"` results)
   - Action: Fix or remove transient TODOs in tests (e.g., mocking improvements, cleanup handlers).
   - Priority: P3
   - Estimate: 0.5d

D. Misc: cross-cutting small improvements
   - Examples: add missing TSDoc, tighten `any` usages, improve error messages.
   - Priority: P4
   - Estimate: small (0.25-1d each)

Next action: I will extract exact TODO lines and create a short checklist (file + line + short description) in this file so you can review before we open Issues. Proceed to extract exact TODO lines now? (yes/no)
