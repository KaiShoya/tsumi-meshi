# v0.1.2 Q&A

## [Release] Where should the release workflow live?
**Question**: Should `.github/workflows/release.yml` be present on `main` or only on `release/*` branches?
**Answer**: Add workflow to repository (present in `release/v0.1.2` branch for testing). For visibility it can exist on `main` as well, but `release/*` usage ensures release-specific runs are isolated. Owner: Kai. Decided on: 2025-12-14

## [E2E] How much E2E coverage is required in CI?
**Question**: Should E2E smoke tests run on every PR or only on release branches/periodic runs?
**Options**:
- Run on every PR: catches regressions early but costs CI minutes.
- Run on release branch or nightly: lower cost, less immediate feedback.
**Decision**: Start with E2E smoke on release branch/Cron; consider expanding to PRs for critical flows later. Owner: Kai. Decided on: 2025-12-14

## [a11y] Custom UI components and aria usage
**Question**: When to add `aria-*` attributes vs. using `sr-only` labels for components like `UInput`/`UButton`?
**Answer**: Prefer using visible or `sr-only` labels for form controls. Avoid adding `aria-label` directly to third-party/custom elements unless they expose a stable role. Document in Copilot instructions. Owner: Kai. Decided on: 2025-12-14
